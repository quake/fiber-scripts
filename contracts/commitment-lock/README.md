# commitment-lock

This is a commitment lock script for ckb fiber network, which implements [daric] protocol.

## Lock Script Args and Witness Structure
The lock script args is concatenated by the following fields:

- `pubkey_hash`: 20 bytes, hash result of blake160(x only aggregated public key)
- `delay_epoch`: 8 bytes, u64 in little endian, must be a relative [EpochNumberWithFraction](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/develop/rpc/README.md#type-epochnumberwithfraction)
- `version`: 8 bytes, u64 in big-endian
- `settlement_hash`: 20 bytes, hash result of blake160(pending_htlc_count || N * pending_htlc || settlement_remote_pubkey_hash || settlement_remote_amount || settlement_local_pubkey_hash || settlement_local_amount)

To unlock this lock, the transaction must provide the following fields in the witness:
- `empty_witness_args`: 16 bytes, fixed to 0x10000000100000001000000010000000, for compatibility with the xudt
- `unlock_count`: 1 byte, 0x00 for revocation unlock, 0x01 ~ 0xFF for settlement unlocks count.

For revocation unlock process, the transaction must provide the following fields in the witness:
- `version`: 8 bytes, u64 in big-endian, must be the same or greater than the version in the lock args
- `pubkey`: 32 bytes, x only aggregated public key
- `signature`: 64 bytes, aggregated signature

For settlement unlock process, the transaction must provide the following fields in the witness:
- `pending_htlc_count`: 1 byte, the count of pending HTLCs
- `pending_htlc`: A group of pending HTLCS, each HTLC is 85 bytes, contains:
    - `htlc_type`: 1 byte, high 7 bits for payment hash type (0000000 for blake2b, 0000001 for sha256), low 1 bit for offered or received type (0 for offered HTLC, 1 for received HTLC)
    - `payment_amount`: 16 bytes, u128 in little endian
    - `payment_hash`: 20 bytes
    - `remote_htlc_pubkey_hash`: 20 bytes, hash result of blake160(remote_htlc_pubkey)
    - `local_htlc_pubkey_hash`: 20 bytes, hash result of blake160(local_htlc_pubkey)
    - `htlc_expiry`: 8 bytes, u64 in little endian, must be an absolute timestamp [since](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0017-tx-valid-since/0017-tx-valid-since.md)
- `settlement_remote_pubkey_hash`: 20 bytes, hash result of blake160(pubkey)
- `settlement_remote_amount`: 16 bytes, u128 in little endian
- `settlement_local_pubkey_hash`: 20 bytes, hash result of blake160(pubkey)
- `settlement_local_amount`: 16 bytes, u128 in little endian

- `unlocks`: A group of settlement unlock signature and preimage
    - `unlock_type`: 0x00 ~ 0xFD for pending htlc group index, 0xFE for settlement remote, 0xFF for settlement local.
    - `with_preimage`: 0x00 without preimage, 0x01 with preimage
    - `signature`: 65 bytes, the signature of the xxx_pubkey
    - `preimage`: 32 bytes, an optional field to provide the preimage of the payment_hash

## Settlement Unlock Process and New Lock Script Args Generation

During the settlement unlock process, when HTLCs are settled or parties claim their funds, a new output cell with updated lock script args is generated. The new lock script args follow the same structure but with updated `settlement_hash`:

### New Settlement Script Generation

The new settlement script is constructed by:

1. **Updated pending HTLCs**: Remove settled HTLCs from the original list
   - `new_pending_htlc_count`: Decremented count after settling HTLCs
   - Remaining unsettled HTLCs in the same 85-byte format

2. **Updated settlement amounts**: Adjust party amounts based on settlements
   - For remote settlement (unlock_type = 0xFE): Set settlement_local_amount to 0 and pubkey hash to 20 bytes zeros
   - For local settlement (unlock_type = 0xFF): Set settlement_remote_amount to 0 and pubkey hash to 20 bytes zeros
   - For HTLC settlements: Deduct payment amounts from total available funds

### New Lock Script Args Construction

The new lock script args are generated as:
```
new_args = [
    pubkey_hash,           // Same as original (20 bytes)
    delay_epoch,           // Same as original (8 bytes)
    version,               // Same as original (8 bytes)
    new_settlement_hash    // Updated hash (20 bytes)
]
```

Where `new_settlement_hash = blake2b_256(new_settlement_script)[0..20]`

### Examples from Tests

1. **Local Settlement**: When local party settles, their settlement amount becomes 0 and pubkey hash is updated to 20 bytes zeros:
   ```rust
   new_settlement_script = [
       new_pending_htlc_count,
       remaining_htlcs...,
       remote_pubkey_hash,
       remaining_remote_amount.to_le_bytes(),
       [0u8; 20],               // Local pubkey hash set to 20 bytes zeros
       0u128.to_le_bytes(),     // Local amount set to 0
   ]
   ```

2. **HTLC Settlement**: When HTLCs are settled, they're removed from pending list:
   ```rust
   new_settlement_script = [
       (original_count - settled_count),
       unsettled_htlcs...,
       settlement_party_data...
   ]
   ```

3. **Batch Settlement**: Multiple HTLCs and party settlements can be processed together, with all changes reflected in the new settlement script.

The verification logic ensures that:
- The new lock script uses the same code_hash and hash_type
- The new args match the expected format with updated settlement_hash
- Output capacity/UDT amount reflects the settled amounts correctly
